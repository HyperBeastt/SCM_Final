<h3>How to makje kaju katli</h3>
<li>step 1: Place 1 cup cashews (kaju) in a dry grinder or coffee grinder or blender. I usually keep cashews at room temperature. Hence the cashews are dry.</li>
<br>
<li>step 2:Grind the kaju to a smooth powder, making sure you don’t over do the grinding process as fat should not release from the cashews.</li>
<br>
<li>step 3: Combine ½ cup sugar and 5 tablespoons water in a thick bottomed pan (or kadai or a non-stick pan).</li>
<br>
<li>step:Keep on low flame and let the sugar dissolve in the water. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.
</li>
<br>
<li>step 4:When the sugar completely dissolves in the water, add the cashew powder.</li>
<br>
<li>step 5:The mixture will thicken and start coming together to form a very soft dough. Then it is time to remove the whole lump of the mixture from the pan and place it on a work surface. This process of making the kaju katli dough took me exactly 8 minutes on a low flame.</li>
<br>
<li>step 5:Put the entire cashew dough on a work surface. Add 1 teaspoon rose petals (or 1 teaspoon rose water or 8 to 9 strands of saffron) and 1 tablespoon ghee or coconut oil. The addition of rose petals and coconut oil or ghee are optional.</li>
<br>
<li> Knead the dough lightly, flatten it and place it on a greased plate or tray. Don’t overdo kneading as this will release fat from the cashews. The grainy texture in the dough goes away as you knead it. Remember the dough should be hot while kneading.</li>
<br>
<li>step 6:You can also place it on a large piece of parchment or butter paper. The cashew dough should still be quite warm when you start rolling it. As it cools it will harden more and then becomes difficult to roll, so work quickly!</li>
<br>
<li>step 7:Knead the dough lightly, flatten it and place it on a greased plate or tray. Don’t overdo kneading as this will release fat from the cashews. The grainy texture in the dough goes away as you knead it. Remember the dough should be hot while kneading.</li>
<br>
<li>step 8:You can also place it on a large piece of parchment or butter paper. The cashew dough should still be quite warm when you start rolling it. As it cools it will harden more and then becomes difficult to roll, so work quickly!</li>
<br>
<li>step 9: To smoothen the cracks, place parchment paper on top and roll more. This will fill in the cracks and the kaju barfi will have a smooth finish.</li>
<br>
<li>step 10:cut the dough in small diamond pieces and serve</li>
