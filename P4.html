<center><h3>How to make jalebi</h3></center>
<li>First, dissolve the yeast in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lukewarm water, and let it sit for 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours to combine. Then add the yeast, melted ghee (or butter or oil), saffron or food coloring, and 2/3 cup water. Stir until there are no more lumps and a thick batter is formed.
</li>
<br>
<li>It should resemble a thick, yellow pancake batter. If it is too thick, it will not come out of the dispenser correctly, and if it is too thin, it will be difficult to shape.
    If the batter is too thin, stir in additional flour one tablespoon at a time to achieve the desired consistency.
    If the batter is too thick, add a small amount of additional water, and stir well, adding more if necessary.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Set the batter aside for 15 minutes. The yeast will work much more quickly to lighten the batter, and the batter can be used right away. However, your jalebi will be lighter if you let the yeast work for a while. Cover the batter and set it aside while you prepare the syrup for the jalebi, and heat the oil for frying.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Assemble your ingredients. This recipe is for a saffron simple syrup. If you do not have saffron available, use a few drops of yellow food coloring to achieve the proper color. It is also common to add other flavorings to this syrup, including lemon, lime, cardamom, and rose water. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Add sugar and water to a pan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down until it is just barely bubbling. Cook the syrup until it reaches the single thread stage, or approximately 220°-222°F (104°-105°C). Watch the syrup carefully to make sure it doesn't burn. This should take around 10-15 minutes on medium-low heat.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Sugar syrups used in Indian cooking are defined by their thread consistency. To test the syrup without a thermometer, dip a spoon or spatula into the syrup and lift it out. Wait a moment and carefully pick up a drop of syrup on your finger. Then touch your finger to your thumb and pull them apart slowly to see how many threads of syrup form.[7] For this recipe, you want a single thread syrup.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fill a heavy-bottomed pot, such as a dutch oven, kadhai, or wok, with enough ghee or oil for deep-frying, between one and two inches. Heat the oil to between 360°-375° F (182°-190°C).</li>
    <br>
    <li> Give the batter a quick stir with a spatula, but do not over-mix. Then pour the batter into a clean squeeze bottle or condiment dispenser.</li>
    <br>
    <li> Using your dispenser, squeeze or pour the batter into the hot oil in coils or spirals that are about 2" wide. [10] Only make 3-4 jalebi at a time to avoid crowding the pan.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The batter will first sink to the bottom, but will quickly pop back up and float to the top. After a minute or two, flip the jalebi over so they cook on both sides. Then remove them from the oil and drain for a moment on paper towels.</li>
